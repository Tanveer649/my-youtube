    // The router sees the parent path /, so it renders Body.

    // If you did not define a child with path /, the <Outlet /> inside Body would stay empty when you visit /.

    // since the body component is routed with the children Maincontainer and watchpage thats why on place of
    // maincontainer and watchpage <outlet> is defined in Body.js component.
